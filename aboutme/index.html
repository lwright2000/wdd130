        <h4>Fun Information</h4>
        <p>I've been attending BYU-Idaho for for 4 semesters and have loved it so far. I took a two year break in my studies to serve my mission in Salt Lake City, Utah. There I gained a love of the Gospel, the people of Salt Lake City, and Basketball. I've lived in Southern Utah for the last 4 years, and before that I lived in Northern Idaho. (I know, what a climate change.)</p>
        <p>I've always been interested in technology and the field of Computer Science, and have delved into the field on several occasions. I built my own desktop when I was in highschool, and attended a trade school that allowed me to learn more about the hardware side of things alongside of highschool. I have always been interested in learning how to code, but never have had the opportunity or knowledge to to advantage of one. I'm excited to get to know everyone better and learn more about Web Design this semester!</p>
